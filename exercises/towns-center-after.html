<h1>Town Center Greens Development</h1>

<p>The Town Center Greens Development is a plan to build 60 units of affordable family housing. The project consists of one-, two- and three-bedroom units. Central City Concern (CCC) submitted the successful proposal to lead the project.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>

<p>The project site is on SE 85th Avenue, between SE Monterey and SE Causey in Happy Valley. The property is close to Clackamas Town Center, transit lines, and other services.</p>

<h2>Who qualifies?</h2>

<p>Households below 60% of the area median income will qualify for affordable housing at the site.</p>
 
<h2>Services</h2>

<p>The proposal includes a resident services program. The program will be based on services provided by those who have succeeded in similar recovery programs.</p>
 
<p>CCC will work with Clackamas County and other partners to reach out to underserved families in need, including one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>families with children who are homeless or at risk of homelessness</li>
    <li>families with household members in recovery from drug and/or alcohol addiction</li>
    <li>survivors of domestic violence</li>
    <li>families working toward regaining custody of children from protective services and foster care</li>
</ul>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>The CCC proposal included a request for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>21 Project-Based Section 8 Vouchers (PBV)</li>
    <li>$1,300,000 in Public Housing Disposition funds from the sale of Public Housing Scattered Site units</li>
    <li>$1,500,000 of HOME Funds administered by Community Development</li>
</ul>

<p>Housing Authority board members awarded the PBV and Disposition funds at the Dec. 18, 2014 board meeting. The Clackamas County Board of Commissioners awarded the HOME funds at the Dec. 18, 2014 business meeting.</p>

<p>CCC was also awarded Low Income Housing Tax Credits from the State of Oregon Housing and Community Services Department. No County General Funds will be used for this project.</p>

<p>Some funds are subject to approval by Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>

<p>HUD requires that the units remain affordable for at least 30 years for the use of Disposition proceeds in the Town Center Greens Project.</p>
