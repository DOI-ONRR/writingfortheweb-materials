<h1>Town Center Greens Development</h1>

<p>The Housing Authority of Clackamas County (HACC), a sub-division of the Housing & Community Development Division (HCD) within the Health, Housing and Human Services Department of Clackamas County issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for new affordable supportive housing developments on March 10, 2014. Central City Concern (CCC) successfully responded to the RFP with a project proposal to build 60 units of affordable supportive family housing (Town Center Greens Project) consisting of a mix of one, two and three-bedroom units that will be made affordable to households below 60 percent of the area median income. The project will be built on a vacant parcel located on SE 85th Avenue, between SE Monterey and SE Causey in Happy Valley. The property is located close to Clackamas Town Center, transit lines and other services.</p>

<p>CCC proposes a broad-based resident services program based on peer-delivered services provided by those who have succeeded in similar recovery programs. CCC proposes to work with Clackamas County and CCC's existing network of partners to outreach to underserved families in need, including one or more of the following: families with children who are homeless or at risk of homelessness; families with household members in recovery from drug and/or alcohol addiction; survivors of domestic violence; and families working toward reunification and regaining custody of children from protective services and foster care.</p>

<p>The CCC proposal included a request for 21 Project Based Section 8 Vouchers (PBV), $1,300,000 in Public Housing Disposition funds generated through the sale of Public Housing Scattered Site units and $1,500,000 of HOME Funds administered by Community Development. The PBV and Disposition funds were awarded to this project by HACC Board Resolution at the December 18, 2014 HACC Board Meeting. The HOME funds were awarded to the project by the Board of County Commissioners at its Dec. 11, 2014 business meeting. In addition, CCC applied for and was awarded Low Income Housing Tax Credits from State of the Oregon Housing and Community Services Department. No County General Funds will be used for this project.</p>

<p>The award of Project Based Section 8 Vouchers and Public Housing Disposition Funds are subject to approval by the Portland Office of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD requires that the units remain affordable for a minimum period of 30 years for the use of Public Housing disposition proceeds in the Town Center Greens Project.</p>
